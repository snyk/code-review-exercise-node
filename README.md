## Testing

You can run the test suite with this command:

```bash
npm run test
```

The project contains unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
Unit tests are located inside of `src/`, next to the code they are testing, whereas integration and end-to-end-tests are located in `tests/`.
You can run them with the following commands:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```
